# simongame
A game based on the physical game Simon, wherein a user has to memorize a pattern that adds a new colour every turn. The HTML and most of the CSS from this project was from a course I took. I wrote the Javascript with some guidance from the course about which order to write things in. I added media queries in the CSS so it's still two columns on smaller screen sizes instead of one column with one colour per row. I also wrote new code using async/await and promise, which I didn't know about previously, to have the pattern replay from the beginning at each turn instead of just playing the newest colour. I had to research these methods and experiment for a few hours before I got it to work!
